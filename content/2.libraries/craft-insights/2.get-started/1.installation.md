description: 'Learn how to install the Insights analytics plugin for Craft CMS.'
---

## Requirements

- Craft CMS 5.0.0 or later
- PHP 8.2 or later

## Craft Plugin Store

To install Insights, navigate to the Plugin Store in your Craft control panel, search for "Insights," and click **Install**.

## Composer

::code-group

```bash [ddev]
ddev composer require samuelreichor/craft-insights &&
ddev craft plugin/install insights
```

```bash [php]
composer require samuelreichor/craft-insights &&
php craft plugin/install insights
```

::

## Add the Tracking Script

After installation, add the tracking script to your base template (usually `_layouts/base.twig` or similar):

```twig
{{ craft.insights.trackingScript() }}
```

::alert{variant=note}
Technically it's not important where you add the script on your page as it always injects the script at the end of the body.
::

That's it! Insights will now track pageviews automatically.

## GeoIP Database (Pro) :badge{label="Pro"}

To enable country tracking, you need to download the free MaxMind GeoLite2-Country database:

1. Create a free account at [MaxMind](https://www.maxmind.com/en/geolite2/signup)
2. Download the **GeoLite2 Country** database (`.mmdb` format)
3. Place the file at `storage/geoip/GeoLite2-Country.mmdb`

Or configure a custom path in your settings:

```php
// config/insights.php
return [
    'geoIpDatabasePath' => '@storage/geoip/GeoLite2-Country.mmdb',
];
```

::alert{variant=note}
Without the GeoIP database, country tracking will be silently skipped. All other features work normally.
