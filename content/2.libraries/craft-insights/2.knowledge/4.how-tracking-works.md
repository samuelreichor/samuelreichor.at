This guide explains every metric you see in the Insights dashboard and how it's calculated.

## Key Metrics

### Pageviews

Total number of page loads across your site.

```
Pageviews = SUM(views) from all pages
```

Every time a page loads and the tracking script fires, this counter increments by 1.

### Unique Visitors

Number of distinct visitors based on daily visitor hashes.

```
Unique Visitors = COUNT(DISTINCT visitorHash) from sessions
```

A visitor is identified by a daily-rotating hash generated from:

```
hash = SHA256(salt | date | ip | browser | language | screen)
```

| Attribute | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **salt** | Daily random value |
| **date** | Current date |
| **ip** | IP address (never stored) |
| **browser** | Browser family only |
| **language** | Primary browser language |
| **screen** | Screen category (s/m/l) |

The same person visiting on different days counts as different visitors. See [Privacy](/libraries/craft-insights/knowledge/privacy) for full details.

### Bounce Rate

Percentage of sessions where the visitor viewed only one page.

```
Bounce Rate = (Sessions with 1 pageview / Total sessions) × 100
```

A "bounce" is when someone visits one page and leaves without viewing another page. Lower is generally better, but depends on content type (blog posts naturally have higher bounce rates).

### Avg. Time on Page

Average time visitors spend on pages, in seconds.

```
Avg. Time = Total time on all pages / Total pageviews
```

Time is measured from page load until the user leaves (navigates away, closes tab, or switches tabs).

### Trend Percentages

The percentage change compared to the previous period.

```
Trend = ((Current value - Previous value) / Previous value) × 100
```

For "Last 7 Days", the previous period is the 7 days before that. A positive trend (green) means growth, negative (red) means decline.

::alert{variant="note"}
If the previous period has zero data, the trend shows 0% instead of infinity.

## Referrers

### Visits

Number of sessions that came from this referrer source.

### Referrer Types

| Type | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Direct** | No referrer - typed URL, bookmark, or app link |
| **Search** | Google, Bing, Yahoo, DuckDuckGo, Baidu, Yandex, Ecosia |
| **Social** | Facebook, Twitter/X, LinkedIn, Instagram, Pinterest, YouTube, TikTok, Reddit |

## Devices

### Device Type

Classified from User-Agent based on device form factor:

| Type | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Desktop** | Computers and laptops |
| **Mobile** | Smartphones |
| **Tablet** | Tablets like iPad, Android tablets |

### Browser

The browser family (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, etc.) extracted from User-Agent.

---

## Real-time Visitors

Number of visitors currently active on your site.

```
Active Visitors = COUNT(visitors) WHERE lastSeen >= (now - realtimeTtl)
```

Default `realtimeTtl` is 300 seconds (5 minutes). A visitor is considered "active" if they've had any activity within this window.

---

## Campaign Tracking :badge{label="Pro"}

### Visits

Number of sessions that arrived with these UTM parameters.

### UTM Parameters

| Parameter | Purpose | Example |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| `utm_source` | Traffic source | `newsletter`, `google` |
| `utm_medium` | Marketing medium | `email`, `cpc`, `social` |
| `utm_campaign` | Campaign name | `spring_sale`, `product_launch` |
| `utm_term` | Paid keywords | `running shoes` |
| `utm_content` | Ad variation | `banner_a`, `text_link` |

---

## Countries :badge{label="Pro"}

### Visits

Number of sessions from visitors in this country.

Country is determined via GeoIP lookup from the visitor's IP address. The IP is immediately discarded after lookup, only the country code is stored.

---

## User Events :badge{label="Pro"}

### Count

Total number of times this event was triggered.

### Unique Visitors

Number of distinct visitors who triggered this event.

---

## Outbound Links :badge{label="Pro"}

### Clicks

Total number of clicks on external links to this domain.

### Unique Visitors

Number of distinct visitors who clicked links to this domain.

---

## Site Searches :badge{label="Pro"}

### Searches

Number of times this search term was used.

### Unique Visitors

Number of distinct visitors who searched for this term.

---

## Scroll Depth :badge{label="Pro"}

### Milestones

| Milestone | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| **25%** | Visitor scrolled past the first quarter |
| **50%** | Visitor reached mid-page |
| **75%** | Visitor showed deep engagement |
| **100%** | Visitor scrolled to the bottom |

Each milestone is counted once per pageview. If a user scrolls down to 75%, then back up, then down to 100%, both 75% and 100% are counted (but 75% only once).

### Average Scroll Depth

```
Avg. Scroll Depth = (25% × count_25 + 50% × count_50 + 75% × count_75 + 100% × count_100) / total_milestone_events
```

This weighted average shows how far visitors typically scroll across your site.

---

## Session Insights :badge{label="Pro"}

### Pages per Session

```
Pages per Session = AVG(pageCount) from all sessions
```

Average number of pages viewed in a single session. Higher values indicate visitors are exploring more content.

### Entry Pages

The first page a visitor sees when starting a session. High-performing entry pages are good landing pages.

### Exit Pages

The last page a visitor sees before leaving. Pages with high exit rates might need improvement (or are natural endpoints like "Thank You" pages).

### Session Definition

A session groups pageviews from the same visitor. A new session starts when:

1. **First visit** - Visitor has no previous activity
2. **Timeout** - More than 30 minutes since last pageview

```
Session timeout = 30 minutes of inactivity
```

## Data Ranges

Available date ranges and their definitions:

| Range | Period |
|-------|--------|
| **Today** | Current calendar day (midnight to now) |
| **Last 7 Days** | Today + previous 6 days |
| **Last 30 Days** | Today + previous 29 days |
| **Last 90 Days** | Today + previous 89 days |
| **Last 12 Months** | Today + previous 365 days |

Trend comparisons use the equivalent previous period (e.g., "Last 7 Days" compares to the 7 days before that).
