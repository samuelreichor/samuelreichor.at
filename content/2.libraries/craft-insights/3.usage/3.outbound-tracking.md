Outbound link tracking helps you understand which external resources your visitors find valuable and where they go when leaving your site.

## Automatic Tracking

External links are tracked automatically. When a user clicks a link to a different domain, Insights captures:

- Target URL
- Target domain
- Link text
- Source page URL

**Example:**

```html
<!-- This click is automatically tracked -->
<a href="https://github.com/example/repo">View on GitHub</a>
```

## Excluding Links

Prevent tracking on specific links with the `data-insights-no-track` attribute:

```html
<!-- This click will NOT be tracked -->
<a href="https://example.com" data-insights-no-track>
    External Link
</a>
```

Use this for:
- Advertising links (to avoid inflating metrics)
- Partner links you don't want to track
- Navigation to your own external properties

## Manual Tracking

Track outbound clicks programmatically:

```javascript
window.insights.trackOutbound(url, text)
```

**Parameters:**

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `url` | `string` | Yes | Target URL |
| `text` | `string` | No | Link text (max 255 chars) |

**Example:**

```javascript
// Track a programmatic redirect
window.insights.trackOutbound('https://partner.com/offer', 'Partner Offer');
window.location.href = 'https://partner.com/offer';
```

## What Gets Tracked

The automatic tracker captures clicks on `<a>` elements where:

1. The `href` points to a different hostname
2. The protocol is `http:` or `https:`
3. The link doesn't have `data-insights-no-track`

**Tracked:**
```html
<a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a>
<a href="http://example.com/page">Example</a>
```

**Not tracked:**
```html
<a href="/local-page">Internal Link</a>
<a href="mailto:test@example.com">Email</a>
<a href="tel:+1234567890">Phone</a>
<a href="https://external.com" data-insights-no-track>Excluded</a>
```

## Viewing Outbound Data

Outbound link data appears in:

1. **Dashboard** - [Outbound Links](/libraries/craft-insights/knowledge/how-tracking-works#outbound-links) card shows top clicked domains
2. **Outbound Page** - Full list with URLs, domains, and click counts

## Use Cases

### Identify Valuable Resources

See which external resources your visitors find most useful:

- Documentation links
- Partner websites
- Social media profiles
- Download sources

### Optimize Affiliate Links

Track affiliate link performance:

```html
<a href="https://affiliate.com/product?ref=yoursite"
   data-insights-event="affiliate_click"
   data-insights-category="conversion">
    Buy Now
</a>
```

Combine with user events for detailed conversion tracking.

### Monitor Exit Points

Identify pages where users commonly leave your site to external destinations.
