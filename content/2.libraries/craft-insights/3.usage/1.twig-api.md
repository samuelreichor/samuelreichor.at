## `trackingScript()`

Registers the tracking script via Craft's asset bundle system.

```twig
{{ craft.insights.trackingScript() }}
```

::alert{variant=note}
  Technically it's not important where you add the script on your page as it always injects the script at the end of the body.

## `trackingScriptInline()`

Outputs the tracking script as inline JavaScript.

```twig
{{ craft.insights.trackingScriptInline()|raw }}
```

Use this when asset bundles aren't available (e.g., in certain caching scenarios).
