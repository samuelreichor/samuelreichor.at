description: 'How Insights ensures GDPR/DSGVO compliance and protects user privacy.'
---

Insights was built from the ground up with privacy as a core principle. It provides meaningful analytics without compromising user privacy or requiring consent banners.

## No Cookies

Insights does not use cookies, localStorage, or any other client-side storage mechanism. This means:

- No cookie consent banner required
- No "accept cookies" popups
- Compliant with strict cookie laws (GDPR, ePrivacy, CCPA)

## No Fingerprinting

Unlike many analytics tools, Insights does not fingerprint users. We don't collect or combine:

- Canvas fingerprints
- WebGL fingerprints
- Audio fingerprints
- Installed fonts or plugins
- Screen resolution (only category: small/medium/large)
- Timezone
- Hardware characteristics

## Visitor Identification

Instead of tracking individuals, Insights uses a daily-rotating hash:

```
hash = SHA256(
    dailySalt +      // Random, regenerated daily
    date +           // Today's date
    browserFamily +  // "Chrome", "Firefox", etc.
    language +       // Primary language ("en", "de")
    screenCategory   // "s", "m", or "l"
)
```

Properties of this approach:

| Property | Benefit |
|----------|---------|
| **Daily rotation** | Same user = new hash tomorrow |
| **No persistence** | Nothing stored on user's device |
| **Non-reversible** | Cannot identify actual person |
| **Collision-tolerant** | Similar users may share hash (by design) |

## IP Address Handling

IP addresses are handled with strict privacy:

### Standard Tracking
IP addresses are **never stored**. They are only used momentarily for:
- Bot detection (checking against known bot IPs)
- Excluded IP filtering (your configured exclusions)

### GeoIP (Pro)
When country tracking is enabled:
1. IP address is sent to the server
2. GeoIP lookup extracts country code only
3. IP address is **immediately discarded**
4. Only country code is stored (e.g., "DE", "US")

```
Request: IP 192.168.1.1 → GeoIP lookup → "DE" → Store "DE" → Discard IP
```

## Data Minimization

Insights practices strict data minimization:

| Collected | Not Collected |
|-----------|---------------|
| Page URL path | Query parameters |
| Referrer domain | Full referrer URL |
| Browser family | Browser version |
| OS family | OS version |
| Device type | Device model |
| Screen category | Exact resolution |
| Primary language | Full Accept-Language |
| Country code | City, region, postal code |

## Aggregated Storage

Raw events are never stored. All data is immediately aggregated:

```
Pageview → UPDATE stats SET views = views + 1 WHERE url = '/page'
```

This means:

- No individual user sessions
- No event logs
- No user timelines
- No way to reconstruct individual behavior

## Data Retention

Configure automatic data cleanup:

```php
// config/insights.php
return [
    'dataRetentionDays' => 365,  // Delete data older than 1 year
    'autoCleanup' => true,       // Run daily cleanup
];
```

Cleanup is automatic and irreversible. Old data is permanently deleted.

## Do Not Track

Insights respects the browser's DNT (Do Not Track) header by default:

```php
'respectDoNotTrack' => true,  // Default
```

When enabled:
- Requests with `DNT: 1` header are not tracked
- No data is collected for these visitors

## User Rights (GDPR)

Because Insights doesn't collect personal data:

| Right | Applicability |
|-------|---------------|
| **Right to access** | No personal data to access |
| **Right to erasure** | No personal data to erase |
| **Right to portability** | No personal data to export |
| **Right to object** | Supported via DNT header |

## Legal Basis

Since Insights:
- Collects no personal data
- Uses no cookies
- Performs no fingerprinting
- Stores only aggregated statistics

It typically falls outside GDPR scope for personal data processing. However, always consult with legal counsel for your specific situation.

## Comparison with Other Tools

| Feature | Insights | Google Analytics | Matomo |
|---------|----------|-----------------|--------|
| Cookies | None | Multiple | Optional |
| Fingerprinting | None | Yes | Optional |
| IP Storage | Never | Anonymized | Configurable |
| Data Location | Your server | Google servers | Your server |
| Consent required | No | Yes | Depends |
| Individual tracking | No | Yes | Yes |

## Configuration Checklist

For maximum privacy:

```php
return [
    // Respect browser privacy preferences
    'respectDoNotTrack' => true,

    // Reasonable data retention
    'dataRetentionDays' => 365,
    'autoCleanup' => true,
];
```
