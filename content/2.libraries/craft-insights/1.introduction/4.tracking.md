## How Tracking Works

Insights uses a lightweight JavaScript tracker that sends events to your Craft backend. All data is processed and stored in aggregated form-no raw event logs or personal data are retained.

## Automatic Tracking

Once you add the tracking script, the following events are tracked automatically:

### Pageviews

Tracked when the page loads. Captures:

- URL path (query parameters stripped)
- Screen size category (small/medium/large)
- Referrer domain (if external)
- Browser and device information (from User-Agent)
- UTM parameters (if present) :badge{label="Pro"}

### Engagement

Tracked when a user interacts with the page:

- **Scroll engagement** - User scrolls past 25% of the page
- **Click engagement** - User clicks anywhere on the page

Engagement events affect bounce rate calculation. A visitor who engages is not counted as a bounce.

### Leave Events

Tracked when the user leaves the page (via `visibilitychange`, `pagehide`, or `beforeunload`). Captures:

- Time spent on page (in seconds)

## Visitor Identification

Insights uses a daily-rotating visitor hash to count unique visitors without fingerprinting:

```
hash = SHA256(dailySalt + date + browserFamily + language + screenCategory)
```

Key properties:

- **Changes daily** - Same visitor gets a new hash tomorrow
- **No persistence** - Nothing stored in cookies or localStorage
- **Non-reversible** - Hash cannot identify the actual user
- **GDPR compliant** - No personal data collected

## Filtering

Certain requests are automatically excluded from tracking:

### Bot Detection

Requests are filtered if the User-Agent contains known bot signatures:

- `bot`, `crawl`, `spider`, `slurp`
- `lighthouse`, `pagespeed`, `gtmetrix`
- `headless`, `phantom`, `selenium`, `puppeteer`
- `wget`, `curl`

### Do Not Track

If `respectDoNotTrack` is enabled (default), requests with the `DNT: 1` header are skipped.

### Excluded Paths

Requests to paths in `excludedPaths` are ignored:

```php
'excludedPaths' => ['/admin', '/cpresources', '/actions']
```

### Excluded IPs

Requests from IPs in `excludedIpRanges` are ignored.

### Logged-in Users

If `excludeLoggedInUsers` is enabled, authenticated Craft users are not tracked.

## Data Aggregation

Instead of storing individual events, Insights aggregates data in real-time:

```
Pageview event → UPDATE pageviews SET views = views + 1
                                      WHERE url = '/about' AND date = '2024-01-15'
```

This approach:

- Minimizes storage requirements
- Ensures GDPR compliance (no raw event data)
- Provides fast query performance

## Queue Processing

By default, tracking events are processed asynchronously via Craft's queue system. This ensures:

- Minimal impact on page load time
- Reliable event processing
- Graceful handling of traffic spikes

Disable queue processing by setting `useQueue` to `false` (events will be processed synchronously).
