This guide walks you through the main features of Insights with screenshots from the Craft control panel.

## Dashboard Overview

The main dashboard gives you a quick overview of your site's traffic. Select a date range to filter all metrics.

Key metrics displayed:

- **Unique Visitors** - Daily-hashed visitor count
- **Bounce Rate** - Percentage of single-page sessions
- **Avg. Time on Page** - Average engagement duration

### Real-time Visitors

See how many visitors are currently active on your site. The widget updates automatically and shows the current count.

Visitors are considered "active" for 5 minutes (configurable via `realtimeTtl`).

## Page Views

Discover which content performs best. The pages table shows:

- URL path
- View count
