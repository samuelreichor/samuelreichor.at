Insights is a privacy-first analytics plugin for Craft CMS. It tracks pageviews, referrers and devices without storing personal data or requiring cookie consent banners.

## What It's Not

Insights is intentionally limited compared to full-featured analytics platforms. It's designed for content-focused websites that need basic traffic insights without complexity.

**Insights is NOT:**

- A Google Analytics replacement for marketing teams
- An A/B testing or conversion optimization platform
- A heat mapping or session recording tool
- A real-time user journey tracker
- An advertising or retargeting platform

**Insights IS:**

- A simple way to see what content performs well
- A privacy-respecting alternative to invasive trackers
- A tool that works without cookie banners
- A lightweight script that won't slow down your site

## Who Should Use Insights?

Insights is ideal for:

- **Content websites** that want basic traffic metrics
- **Agency clients** who need simple, understandable stats
- **GDPR-conscious sites** that want to avoid cookie consent issues
- **Performance-focused developers** who want minimal tracking overhead

Consider a different tool if you need:

- User-level tracking and segmentation
- E-commerce conversion funnels
- Marketing attribution modeling
- Integration with advertising platforms

## How Data Is Stored

Unlike traditional analytics that store individual events, Insights aggregates data immediately:

```
Pageview → UPDATE pageviews SET views = views + 1 WHERE url = '/about'
```

This means:

- **Smaller database** - No individual event logs
- **Faster queries** - Pre-aggregated data
- **Better privacy** - No way to reconstruct user sessions
- **GDPR compliant** - No personal data stored

## Script Size

The tracking script is approximately 3KB (gzipped) and loads asynchronously. It has zero dependencies and won't block page rendering.

For comparison:

| Script | Size (gzipped) |
|--------|----------------|
| Insights | ~3 KB |
| Google Analytics | ~45 KB |
| Matomo | ~22 KB |
| Plausible | ~1 KB |
