The `@query-api/react` package provides a powerful query builder for React, enabling you to build URLs for fetching data from Craft CMS in a way similar to Twig queries. 

It allows you to connect your Craft CMS sections and entry types to React components, making it easy to render dynamic content in your React applications.

## Requirements

- The [Craft Query API](/libraries/craft-query-api) plugin must be installed and properly configured in Craft CMS.

## Supported Element Types

The library supports building urls for the following Craft CMS element types:

- Addresses
- Assets
- Entries
- Users
