## Features

- **Query builder:** Easily build and execute queries directly from Next.js, enabling flexible, real-time data retrieval from Craft CMS
- **Data Driven Components:** Connect your data directly with your Vue components, to speed up development.
- **Get Only the Data You Need:** Avoid overfetching by using a custom function in the query builder to select only the fields you require.
- **Pretty JSON:** JSON transformers are in place to format the response for better readability.
- **Support for Main Element Types:** Query addresses, assets, entries and users.
- **Full TypeScript Support**: A fully-typed query builder for Craft CMS. Pretty cool, huh? ðŸ˜Ž
- **Multisite Helpers**: Built-in helpers to support Craft Multisites.

## Examples

Want to see how it works?

```ts [App.tsx]
const { data, loading, error } = useCraftEntry()
  .section('news')
  .fields(['title']) // add more field handles if you like
  .limit(3)
  .all()
```

It is as simple as that. ðŸš€ The response will contain three entries from the 'news' section.
