The `CraftPage` component maps section handles defined in Craft CMS to pages in Nuxt / Vue  via the `config` prop. 
The `content` prop receives the actual data from your Craft CMS query, typically using `useCraftQuery()`.

## Available Props

The `CraftPage` component accepts the following props:

```vue[CraftPage.vue]
<script setup lang="ts">
  type ContentMapping = {
    pages:
      {
        [key: string]: Record<string, DefineComponent>;
        Error?: Record<string, DefineComponent>;
      }
    components: {
      [key: string]: Record<string, DefineComponent>;
    };
  };

  const props = defineProps({
    config: {
      type: Object as PropType<ContentMapping>,
      required: true,
    },
    content: {
      type: Object,
      required: true,
    },
  });
</script>
```

### Props Explanation

- `config`: An object that maps Craft CMS section handles to Nuxt / Vue components. It should include:
  - `pages`: Defines the section handle and its corresponding Nuxt / Vue page component. Optionally, an `Error` component can be included.
  - `components`: Maps specific content blocks to Nuxt / Vue components based on field handles.

- `content`: The actual content data returned from a Craft CMS query, such as one created with `useCraftQuery()`.

## Error Handling

If you're using a catch-all route, you can add an `Error` page template to your `config` mapping. 
This ensures that any unmapped or erroneous sections gracefully display an error page, improving user experience and preventing unexpected behavior.
