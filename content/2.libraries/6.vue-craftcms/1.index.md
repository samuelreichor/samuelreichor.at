## Features

- **Craft CMS query url builder:** Easily build urls for the Craft Query API plugin directly from Vue, enabling flexible, real-time data retrieval from Craft CMS

- **Built in Helper Components:** Connect your data directly with your Vue components, to speed up development.

- **Get Only the Data You Need:** Avoid overfetching by using a custom function in the query builder to select only the fields you require.

- **Pretty Json:** Json Transformer are in place to prettify the response.

- **Support for main Element Types:** Query addresses, assets, entries and users.

## Examples

Want to see how it works?

```ts [app.vue]
const queryUrl = useCraftUrlBuilder('entries')
  .id(1)
  .status('active')
  .siteId(1)
  .buildUrl('one')
```

It is as simple as that. ðŸš€ The response will be the url that you can use to fetch your data.
