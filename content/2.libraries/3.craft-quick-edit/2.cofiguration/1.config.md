## Configuration

Create a `quick-edit.php` file under your `/config` directory with the following options available to you. You can also use multi-environment options to change these per environment.

```php [./config/quick-edit.php]
<?php

return [
    '*' => [
        'isGlobalDisabled' => false,
        'targetBlank' => false,
        'isStandalonePreview' => false,
        'linkText' => '',
    ]
];
```

- `isGlobalDisabled`: Disables Quick Edit globally. So no edit link will be shown.
- `targetBlank`: Opens the control panel edit link in a new window.
- `isStandalonePreview`: Enable this option to open the edit link in the standalone preview mode (Only available in > Craft 5.6.0).
- `linkText`: Hides the icon in the edit link and displays text instead.

This File will overwrite the settings from the control panel.

## Control Panel

You can also manage configuration settings through the Control Panel by visiting Settings â†’ Quick Edit.
