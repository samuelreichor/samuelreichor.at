---

The `@query-api/next` introduces a powerful query builder to your Next.js app, allowing you to easily fetch data from Craft CMS, 
similar to how you would in Twig.

It allows you to connect your Craft CMS sections and entry types to React components, making it easy to render dynamic content in your Next.js applications.

## Requirements

- The [Craft Query API](/libraries/craft-query-api) plugin must be installed and properly configured in Craft CMS.
- Node.js - 20.x or newer (but I recommend the [active LTS release](https://github.com/nodejs/release#release-schedule))

## Supported Element Types

The library supports querying for the following Craft CMS element types:

- Addresses
- Assets
- Entries
- Users

## Need Help?
