## Requirements

- The [Craft Query API](/libraries/craft-query-api) plugin must be installed and properly configured in Craft CMS.
- Node.js - 20.x or newer (but I recommend the [active LTS release](https://github.com/nodejs/release#release-schedule))

## Installation

The fastest way to get started is with the `create-query-api` command-line tool. It scaffolds a complete project for you, including a pre-configured Craft CMS and a Next.js frontend.

Open your terminal and run the following command:

```bash
npx create-query-api@latest query-api-next --template next
```

## Manual Installation

If you want to integrate the `@query-api/next` SDK into an existing Next.js project or want to understand the setup process step by step, you can head over to the [Manual Setup Guide](/libraries/query-api-next/get-started/manual-setup)
