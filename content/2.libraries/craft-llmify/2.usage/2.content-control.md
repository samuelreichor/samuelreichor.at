To select content for markdown generation, you can use the `llmify` and `excludeLlmify` tags in your templates. 
These tags allow you to specify which parts of your content should be converted to markdown and which parts should be excluded.

## `llmify`

The body of `llmify` tags will be converted to markdown. You can use multiple `llmify` tags in your templates. They get merged together and the result is saved as a markdown file.

```twig [templates/entry.twig]
{% llmify %}
    <h1>My Title</h1>
    <p>My content</p>
{% endllmify %}

{% llmify %}
    <p>More content</p>
{% endllmify %}
``` 

This will result in a markdown file that looks like this:

```markdown
# My Title
My content
More content
```

## `excludeLlmify`

In cases where you want to exclude certain content from being converted to markdown, you can use the `excludeLlmify` tag. This is useful for content that should not be part of the markdown generation.

```twig [templates/entry.twig]
{% llmify %}
    <h1>My Title</h1>
    <p>My content</p>
    {% excludeLlmify %}
        <p>This content will not be included in the markdown file.</p>
    {% endexcludeLlmify %}
{% endllmify %}
```

This will result in a markdown file that looks like this:

```markdown
# My Title
My content
``` 

## Exclude by Class

If you need even more control about what gets included in the markdown generation, you can use the `exclude-llmify` class on any HTML. 
If this class conflicts or you have multiple classes that should be excluded, you can configure them in the `llmify.php` config file.

```twig [templates/entry.twig]
{% llmify %}
    <h1>My Title</h1>
    <p>My content</p>
    <p class="exclude-llmify">This content will not be included in the markdown file.</p>
{% endllmify %}
```

This will result in a markdown file that looks like this:

```markdown
# My Title
My content
```
