As of now the LLMify plugin provides two console commands to manage the markdown generation process. 

You can run these commands in CI/CD pipelines or as cron jobs to automate the markdown generation process.

## `craft llmify/markdown/generate`

This will generate the markdown files for all entries that are enabled for markdown generation and have the `llmify` tag in their templates.

```bash
php craft llmify/markdown/generate
```

## `craft llmify/markdown/clear`

This will clear all generated markdown files. This is useful if you want to regenerate the markdown files from scratch.

```bash
php craft llmify/markdown/clear
```
