It is important to set LLM Title and Description for each content type, as they are used in the `llms.txt` file to provide context for the LLMs.

## Entry Settings

LLMify has an LLMify Settings Field that you can add to your Entry Types. You can use this field do overwrite the content settings for each entry.

## LLMify Utility

The LLMify Utility is a utility that allows you to manage the markdown generation process. You can access it in the Craft CMS control panel under Utilities.

You can use this to manually trigger the markdown generation process for all entries that are enabled for markdown generation and have the `llmify` tag in their templates.

If you only want to update one markdown, you can also use the Sidebar Panel in the entry edit page.

## Cron jobs

You can also set up cron jobs to automate the markdown generation process. The LLMify plugin provides console commands that you can use for this purpose:

```bash
// Generate markdown files for all entries every day at midnight
0 0 * * * php /path/to/craft llmify/markdown/generate
```
