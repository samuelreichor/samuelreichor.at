## Configuration

Create a `llmify.php` file under your `/config` directory with the following options available to you. You can also use multi-environment options to change these per environment.

```php [./config/llmify.php]
<?php

return [
    '*' => [
        // Whether Markdown creation should be enabled.
        'isEnabled' => true,

        // Whether real or the markdown urls should be used in the llms.txt file.
        'isRealUrlLlm' => false,

        // This prefix is used to generate links for the markdowns (eg. https://example.com/raw/__home__.md).
        // Change this if there is a conflict with the raw prefix.
        'markdownUrlPrefix' => 'raw',

        // Classes that should be excluded from the LLMify markdown generation.
        'excludeClasses' => [
            [
                'classes' => 'exclude-llmify',
            ],
            [
                'classes' => 'another-llmify-exclude-class',
            ],
        ];

        // The max number of concurrent requests to use when generating the markdown.
        'concurrentRequests' => 3,

        // The max amount of seconds requests can take.
        'requestTimeout' => 100,

        // Configuration for the markdown generation. 
        // You can see all available options here https://github.com/thephpleague/html-to-markdown.
        'markdownConfig' => [
            'strip_tags' => true,
            'header_style' => 'atx',
            'remove_nodes' => 'img picture style',
        ],
    ],

    'dev' => [
        'isEnabled' => false,
    ]
];
```
