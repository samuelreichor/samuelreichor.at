Want to see how it works?

```ts [app.ts]
import { buildCraftQueryUrl } from 'js-craftcms-api';

// Build URL for fetching a single address
const url = buildCraftQueryUrl('entries')
  .id(1)
  .status('active')
  .siteId(1)
  .buildBaseUrl('one');
// Result: /v1/api/queryApi/customQuery?elementType=addresses&id=1&status=active&siteId=1&one=1
```

It is as simple as that. ðŸš€
