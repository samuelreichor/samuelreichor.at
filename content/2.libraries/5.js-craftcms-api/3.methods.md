This API allows building urls for Craft CMS elements (addresses, assets, entries, and users) by providing a querybuilder.

## Supported Element Types

Each element type has its own set of available methods. This ensures precise control and great type safty.

- Addresses
- Assets
- Entries
- Users

::alert{variant="note"}
  Categories, Tags and Globals are not supported because they may be deprecated in the future.
::

## Special Methods

These are methods available for all element types and are not native in Craft CMS.

::alert{variant="tip"}
  When the type is defined as `number[]`, you can always include operator strings such as `not` or `and`. You can find out more about types and methodes in the [source code](https://github.com/samuelreichor/js-craftcms-api/blob/main/src/index.ts).
