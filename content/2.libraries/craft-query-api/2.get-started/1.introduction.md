The Query API extends your Craft CMS project with endpoints, allowing you to query Addresses, Assets, Entries, and Users using simple URL parameters. 

The plugin speeds up and simplifies headless development with Craft CMS, so you as a developer can focus on the important parts of your application.

## Frontend SDKs
It’s designed to make headless development incredibly fast and flexible, especially when paired with our SDKs. These libraries let you build queries in JavaScript 
using a query builder that feels just like Craft’s native Twig syntax.

::alert{variant="note"}
To access any API endpoint, you must include a valid access token. This enforces secure, scoped access to your Craft CMS data.
