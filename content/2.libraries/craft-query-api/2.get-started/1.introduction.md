---

The Query API extends your Craft CMS project with endpoints, allowing you to query Addresses, Assets, Entries, and Users using simple URL parameters.

It’s designed to make headless development incredibly fast and flexible, especially when paired with [Nuxt SDK](/libraries/nuxt-craftcms) or [Vue SDK](/libraries/vue-craftcms). These libraries let you build queries in JavaScript using a query builder that feels just like Craft’s native Twig syntax.

## Requirements

- Requires Craft CMS 5.0.0 or later.
- PHP 8.2 or later.
- For optimal image performance, it's highly recommended to use [ImagerX](https://imager-x.spacecat.ninja/overview.html).

## Supported Element Types

- Addresses
- Assets
- Entries
- Users

::alert{variant="note"}
To access any API endpoint, you must include a valid access token. This enforces secure, scoped access to your Craft CMS data.
