If you're using a reverse proxy (with some Nginx magic) and serve both frontend and backend from the same domain, you usually don't need to configure these things.
You can see an example of this setup in the [craft-nuxt starter repository](https://github.com/samuelreichor/craft-nuxt-starter).

## Configure Cors Origins

To prevent CORS origin errors in your frontend, you should configure allowed origins in the `config/app.web.php` file.
Add the following configuration to define which domains are allowed to make cross-origin requests:

```php
<?php

  return [
      'as corsFilter' => [
          'class' => \craft\filters\Cors::class,

          // Add your origins here
          'cors' => [
              'Origin' => [
                  'http://localhost:3000',
              ],
              'Access-Control-Request-Method' => ['GET'],
              'Access-Control-Request-Headers' => ['*'],
              'Access-Control-Allow-Credentials' => true,
              'Access-Control-Max-Age' => 86400,
              'Access-Control-Expose-Headers' => [],
          ],
      ],
  ];
```


## Headless Mode
Set headless mode in your `config/general.php` to true.

## Enable Preview
To enable previewing entries etc. you have to tell Craft CMS, where the frontend lives.

### Add a new env var:

```php [.env]
WEBSITE_URL="http://localhost:3000"
```

### Add new alias to Craft CMS:

Now add this recently created env var to your `config/general.php` as an alias.

```php [config/general.php]
->aliases([
    '@websiteUrl' => getenv('WEBSITE_URL'),
])
```

### Change Site URL

And finally go to your control panel settings -> sites -> and change the base URL of your Site. If you click on the Craft CMS logo in the left top corner, you should land on your defined `WEBSITE_URL`
