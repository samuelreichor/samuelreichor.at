The API endpoints are blazingly fast. ðŸš€

## Caching Strategy

The plugin utilizes Craft's built-in caching mechanism, similar to the `{% cache %}` tag in Twig. 

Caches are automatically invalidated when any element in the request changes. The cache will persist based on the `cacheDuration` setting defined in your configuration. You can adjust this in your [Craft CMS configuration](https://craftcms.com/docs/5.x/reference/config/general.html#cacheduration).

You can learn how to override that in the [Settings Page]().

  A new cache is created when a previously unqueried element is requested. However, simply changing the order of your GET parameters will NOT generate a new cache.

## Eager Loading

To optimize the initial cache generation, eager loading is used to reduce the number of database queries. This is handled automatically through an internal eager loading map, so no additional configuration is required. You should however try to reuse relational fields to keep things scalable.
