You can define a multi environment aware config in `/config/query-api.php`. You can find an [example in that file](https://github.com/samuelreichor/craft-query-api/blob/main/src/config.php).

## `cacheDuration`

 Defines the cache duration. Defaults to the cache duration defined in your `general.php`. 

 ```php
return [
  'production' => [
    'cacheDuration' => 3600, // cache for 1h
  ]
]
``` 

## `excludedFieldClasses`

Define field classes that should be excluded from the json response. Used for example for excluding the seo settings field, because SEOmatic has its own API endpoint for that.

 ```php
return [
  'production' => [
    'excludeFieldClasses' => ['nystudio107\seomatic\fields\SeoSettings'],
  ]
]
``` 

## `includeAllEntry`

Defines how entry relations from an Entries field are returned. If enabled, the `customQuery` endpoint will include full entry objects, otherwise only minimal data (title, URI, ID, slug) is returned.

```php
return [
  '*' => [
    'includeAllEntry' => true,
  ]
]
``` 

::alert{variant="warning"}
If you use this, be sure that you don't have circular entry relations. This would end up in an endless loop.
::

## `typeGenerationMode`

Determines how ts types for your frontend should be created.

### Manuel

Set it to `manuel` if you want to create your type definitions manually with the `craft query-api/generate-types` command.

```php
return [
  'dev' => [
    'typeGenerationMode' => 'manual',
  ]
]
``` 
### Auto

Set it to `auto` if you want to recreate your type definitions on demand, everything your project config changes.

```php
return [
  'dev' => [
    'typeGenerationMode' => 'auto',
  ]
]
``` 

::alert{variant="warning"}
This will only run if you change the project config through the Craft CMS control panel. If you run `craft project-config/apply` it will NOT run. Then you have to do it manually with the `craft query-api/generate-types` command.
::

## `typeGenerationOutputPath`

Defines where ts definitions get created. Aliases can be used here as well.

```php
return [
  'dev' => [
    'typeGenerationOutputPath' => '@root/queryApiTypes.ts',
  ]
]
