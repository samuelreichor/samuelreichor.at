---

The `customQuery` endpoint allows you to query addresses, assets, entries, and users directly via URL parameters. It returns a JSON response for easy consumption.

To use it, simply send a GET request to: `${PRIMARY_SITE_URL}/v1/api/queryApi/customQuery` with some query params. This could look like that
`/v1/api/queryApi/customQuery?elementType=entries&section=home&one=1`.

A full example with an access token might look like this: 

```bash
curl --request GET \
  --url 'https://your-site.ddev.site/v1/api/queryApi/customQuery?elementType=entries&section=home&one=1' \
  --header 'authorization: Bearer your-access-token'
```

## GET Params

Each element type has its own set of available GET parameters. This ensures precise control over the query and enhances security. Internally, these parameters are filtered to prevent potential exploits.

## Special Parameters

Below is a list of special GET parameters that are available in all element types.

| Params      | Description                           | Possible Values                      |
|-------------|---------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| all         | Fetch all elements                    | 1                                    |
| elementType | Specify the element type to query     | addresses, assets, entries, users    |
| includeAllEntry | Whether to include the full data of entries or just the minimal fields (title, URI, ID, and slug). | 1 for true and 0 for false |
| fields      | Query specific field data by handle   | string or array of field handles, use dot notation to filter out nested data, use * as a wildcard |
| one         | Fetch a single element                | 1                                    |

::alert{variant="note"}
 The following parameters are required: `elementType` and either `one` or `all`.
::

### `fields`

The `fields` param is a simple filter, to minify the response returned to the client. 
You can use a `*` in combination with `fieldhandle.nestedFieldHandle`, to filter out stuff that is not important. 

### `includeAllEntry`

The `includeAllEntry` defines how entry relations from an Entries field are returned. 
If enabled, the `customQuery` endpoint will include full entry objects, otherwise only minimal data (title, URI, ID, slug) is returned.
To enable this setting globally you can use the [includeAllEntry setting](/libraries/craft-query-api/usage/settings#includeallentry)

::alert{variant="warning"}
If you use the `includeAllEntry` param, be sure that you don't have circular entry relations. This would end up in an endless loop.
