## Define Loanwords
Once you've installed the Loanwords plugin, you'll gain access to a dedicated section in Craft CMS for managing your loanwords.

![Loanwords Overview](/images/bitmap/loanword-overview.png)

When you click on `New Loanword` you add new words. After saving, you can use the `a11yTextReplacer()` Twig extension in your templates.

## Usage in Frontent

After saving, you can use the `a11yTextReplacer()` Twig extension in your templates. This automatically replaces loanwords in your content with the correct <span lang=""> tags. 

```[example.twig]

{{ a11yTextReplacer(entry.richText) | raw }}

```

This extension takes an string as an argument. 

## Settings

The Loanwords plugin includes customizable settings to define default values and behavior. These settings are stored in the `project.yaml` file, ensuring consistency across environments.

### Default Language

Defines the default language for loanwords, used when no specific language is assigned. This setting can be overridden for individual loanwords and defaults to English.

### Case-Sensitive Replacement

Enable this option to make the replacement process case-sensitive. For example, if "Cafe" is defined as a loanword but the text contains "cafe," it will not be tagged unless the capitalization matches exactly.

### Default CSS Class

Specify a CSS class to style all loanwords consistently. If left blank, the plugin applies a default inline style of `position: inline`.

## Config

To use a custom configuration file, create a loanwords.php file in your config directory:

```php[loanwords.php]
<?php

return [
    'defaultLang' => 'de-AT', // Default language for loanwords
    'caseSensitive' => false, // Enable or disable case-sensitive replacement
    'cssClass' => 'inline', // Default CSS class for loanwords
];
```

When this file is present, it will override the settings from the Control Panel. This approach is ideal for managing shared configurations across multiple environments or teams.
