## Configuration

Create a `loanwords.php` file under your `/config` directory with the following options available to you. You can also use multi-environment options to change these per environment.

```php [./config/loanwords.php]
<?php

return [
    '*' => [
        'defaultLang' => 'de-AT',
        'caseSensitive' => false,
        'cssClass' => 'inline',
    ]
];
```

- `defaultLang`: Sets the default language for loanwords, defaults to `en`.
- `caseSensitive`: Makes the replacement process case-sensitive, matching capitalization exactly, defaults to `false`
- `cssClass`: Defines a CSS class for styling loanwords, defaults to `position: inline` as style if left blank.
