Let's dive in and use that thing! This package offers flexible methods for integrating Craft CMS data into your Vue application.

## Build Query URLs

This package does not include direct fetching from your Craft CMS backend to keep things flexible for you. Instead, you can use `useCraftUrlBuilder()` to create custom query URLs and implement your own fetch function as needed.

You can build an url like that:

```ts [app.vue]
const queryUrl = useCraftUrlBuilder('entries')
  .id(1)
  .status('active')
  .buildUrl('one')

//result = https://your-primary-site-url/v1/api/queryApi/customQuery?elementType=entries&id=1&status=active&one=1
```

## Connect Components 

You can map Craft CMS section handles and matrix block handles to Vue components, enabling the module to automatically render Vue pages and Vue blocks based on your content structure. This method simplifies data rendering by letting the package handle the content logic.
