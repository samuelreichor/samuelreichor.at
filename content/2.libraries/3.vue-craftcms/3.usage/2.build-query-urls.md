## Overview

In this guide, you’ll learn to use the `useCraftUrlBuilder()` composable to build custom query URLs for your Craft CMS backend. This approach offers precise control over the data you retrieve, allowing you to specify fields and configure queries to suit your needs.

## Build an Url

The `useCraftUrlBuilder()` composable lets you construct a query URL step-by-step. Here’s how to set up a query URL to fetch a list of related news articles:


```ts
const queryUrl = useCraftUrlBuilder('entries')
  .section('news')
  .fields(['title'])
  .limit(3)
  .buildUrl('one')

//result = https://your-primary-site-url/v1/api/queryApi/customQuery?elementType=entries&id=1&status=active&one=1
```

  Find out more about the available query methodes in the [useCraftQuery()](/libraries/vue-craftcms/composables/use-craft-url-builder) docs.

## Fetch with Query Urls

After building the query URL, you can use it in a fetch function to retrieve data:

For example: 

```ts
const queryUrl = useCraftUrlBuilder('entries')
  .section('news')
  .fields(['title'])
  .limit(3)
  .buildUrl('one')

const data = ref(await fetchData(queryUrl));
```

  You probalby want to have an error handling that fits your needs.
::

Here is a small fetch function with some error handling in place. 

```ts [~/utils/fetcher.ts]
export async function fetchData(url: string) {
  const response = await fetch(url);
  if (!response.ok) {
    throw new Error(`Failed to fetch data from ${url}: ${response.statusText}`);
  }

  return await response.json();
}
```

This approach allows you to fetch only the data you need from Craft CMS, making your application more efficient and responsive.
