Let's dive in and use that thing! This package offers flexible methods for integrating Craft CMS data into your Vue application.

## Build Query Urls

This package does not support fetching to your Craft CMS backend, because of limitations of vue. But you can build your own query urls with the `useCraftUrlBuilder()` and make a custom fetch function. 

You can build an url like that:

```ts [app.vue]
const queryUrl = useCraftUrlBuilder('entries')
  .id(1)
  .status('active')
  .buildUrl('one')

//result = https://your-primary-site-url/v1/api/queryApi/customQuery?elementType=entries&id=1&status=active&one=1
```

## Connect Components 

You can map Craft CMS section handles and matrix block handles to Vue components, enabling the module to automatically render vue pages and vue blocks based on your content structure. This method simplifies data rendering by letting the package handle the content logic.
