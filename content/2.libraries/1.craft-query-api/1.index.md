## Features

- **Dynamic URL-Based Queries**: Easily build and execute Craft CMS dynamic queries directly from URL parameters, enabling flexible, real-time data retrieval for headless Craft CMS or traditional setups.

- **Get Only the Data You Need**: Avoid overfetching by using a custom function in the query builder to select only the fields you require.

- **Pretty JSON Responses**: JSON Transformers prettify the response for better readability.

- **Bearer Token Auth**: Define schemas and bearer tokens in the controlpanel to control who can access your data. 

- **Native and Custom Field Detection**: Automatically detects native Craft CMS fields and custom fields across all element types.

- **Comprehensive Content API**: Supports querying for addresses, assets, entries, and users, providing a complete Content API for Craft CMS.

- **Prerendering Helper**: Fetch all active page URLs for prerendering, static site generation, or enhanced performance.

- **Optimized Data Retrieval**: High-performance content access with smart caching strategies ensures your queries run fast.

- **Extensible**: You can add your own Json Transformer and custom element types to the Query API.

## Usage in Frontend
The Craft Query API Plugin is highly adaptable. It comes with npm packages for Vue, Nuxt, and TypeScript, making integration seamless. These packages enable developers to easily use the query builder to fetch data dynamically from your frontend with minimal configuration.

Example with Nuxt:
```ts [app.vue]
const { data, error } = await useCraftEntry()
  .section('news')
  .limit(3)
  .all()

if (error.value) {
  console.error(error.value)
}
```

This approach simplifies the process of querying Craft CMS with JavaScript, making it a powerful tool for dynamic data retrieval.

## ImagerX Support

The Craft Query API Plugin automatically detects named transforms and widths defined in your ImagerX configuration. When querying images, it applies these pre-defined transformations, returning an optimized srcset for each image. 

The Craft Query API Plugin integrates seamlessly with ImagerX. It detects and applies named transforms and widths from your configuration. When querying images, these transformations automatically return an optimized `srcset`.

## Access Control with Schemas

Schemas allow you to define fine-grained access control for your data. Each access token is associated with one schema, which defines what content the token can access. 
This ensures a secure and predictable way of querying data via the API.

When creating a schema, you can assign permissions for specific content types, such as:

- Site
- Section
- Volume
- User Group
- Address
- Custom Elementtypes

This setup gives you full flexibility to tailor access to your needs — for example, restricting a token to only a specific section or user group.

Here’s an example of what a schema configuration might look like:

## Why not GraphQl?

### Productivity

GraphQL requires detailed schemas, fragments, which can feel counterproductive for developers focused on efficiency.

### Steep Learning Curve

If you're new to GraphQL, the syntax, schema design, error handling and tooling like Apollo can take significant time to learn. The Craft Query API Plugin works right out of the box like you were used to in twig.

### Built for Large Orgs

GraphQL was originally developed by Facebook to address specific challenges they faced while building and maintaining their large-scale applications. It is often an overkill for smaller projects.

### Overhead and Architectural Complexity

Flexibility in GraphQL leads to a lot things you have to think of. Maintainability and error handling is hard with graphQl. The Craft CMS Query API eliminates this overhead.

### Prop Drilling

If the software architecture is not thoughtfully designed, it can lead to prop drilling everywhere. Data fetched in a parent component must be passed through multiple layers of child components. This approach complicates state management, increases maintenance overhead, and detracts from the overall developer experience.

### Available Integrations

The Craft Query API offers several integrations for modern frontend frameworks:

- [Js Craft CMS API](/libraries/js-craftcms-api): The core package, you can build wrappers around it to support your framework. If you want to build a wrapper around it for your framework -> Hit me up :) 

- [Vue Craft CMS](/libraries/vue-craftcms): A package to use the query builder in Vue.

- [Nuxt Craft CMS](/libraries/nuxt-craftcms): A package to use the query builder in Nuxt.
