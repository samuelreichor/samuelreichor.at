## Features

- **Dynamic URL-Based Queries:** Easily build and execute queries directly from URL parameters, enabling flexible, real-time data retrieval across any frontend or platform.

- **Get Only the Data You Need:** Avoid overfetching by using a custom function in the query builder to select only the fields you require.

- **Pretty Json:** Json Transformer are in place to prettify the response.

- **Native and Custom Field Detection:** Recognizes both native Craft fields and custom fields across all element types, ensuring effortless compatibility with any data model.

- **Comprehensive Content API:** Supports querying of all main element types, including addresses, assets, entries, and users, building a complete API for versatile content needs.

- **Prerendering Support:** Provides an endpoint to fetch all active page URLs, perfect for prerendering, static site generation, and enhanced site performance.

- **Optimized Data Retrieval:** Built for high-performance content access, with smart caching strategies in place.

## ImagerX Support

The Craft Query API Plugin automatically detects named transforms and widths defined in your ImagerX configuration. When querying images, it applies these pre-defined transformations, returning an optimized srcset for each image. 

## Usage in Frontend
The Craft Query API Plugin is designed to be highly adaptable, with dedicated npm packages available for Vue, Nuxt, and TypeScript to make integration as seamless as possible. These packages allow developers to easily use the query builder in frontend projects, enabling dynamic data fetching with minimal configuration.

This could look like that (in Nuxt): 
```ts [app.vue]
const queryUrl = useCraftQuery('entries')
  .id(1)
  .status('active')
  .siteId(1)
  .one()
```

## Why not GraphQl?

### Productivity

As developers, we often strive for efficiency, but GraphQL can feel counterproductive. Writing long detailed queries for every request, managing fragments, and debugging deeply nested issues can be a pain in your ass.

### Steep Learning Curve

If you’re new to GraphQL, get ready to invest some time learning its syntax, schema design, apollo (or something else), and code patterns. Sure, it’s powerful once you get the hang of it, but for teams without prior experience, onboarding can be a real drag.

### Built for Large Orgs

GraphQL was originally developed by Facebook to address specific challenges they faced while building and maintaining their large-scale applications. It is often an overkill for smaller projects.

### Overhead and Architectural Complexity

Flexibility sounds great—until it becomes your worst enemy. You’ve got to define schemas, write fetch functions, handle preview mode, build router for your sections, etc. For many use cases, this is overkill. A query builder often gets the job done with far less effort and fewer moving parts.

### Prop Drilling

If the software architecture is not thoughtfully designed, it can lead to prop drilling everywhere. Data fetched in a parent component must be passed through multiple layers of child components. This approach complicates state management, increases maintenance overhead, and detracts from the overall developer experience.
