You can fetch elements (such as addresses, assets, entries, and users) using the `customQuery` endpoint. If you need to retrieve all routes, the `allRoutes` endpoint is available.

  For more details, check out the [customQuery](/libraries/craft-query-api/endpoints/custom-query) and [allRoutes](/libraries/craft-query-api/endpoints/all-routes) documentation.

You can either manually build your URLs or leverage one of the following Query Builders for JavaScript frameworks:

## Nuxt

Integrate Craft CMS with Nuxt using the [Nuxt Craft CMS Module](/libraries/Nuxt-craftcms). This module makes it easy to build and execute queries directly within your Nuxt components.

## Vue

For Vue.js applications, the [Vue Craft CMS Package](/libraries/vue-craftcms) offers a simple and intuitive way to query your Craft CMS content effortlessly.

## Build Your Own

If your favorite framework isnâ€™t listed here, you can use the [JS Craft CMS API](/libraries/js-craftcms-api) to create custom queries tailored to your specific needs. Feel free to reach out if you need any help! :)
