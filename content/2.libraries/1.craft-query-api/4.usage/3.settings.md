You can define a multi environment aware config in `craft/config/craft-query-api.php`. You can find an [example in that file](https://github.com/samuelreichor/craft-query-api/blob/main/src/config.php).

## `cacheDuration`

 Defines the cache duration. Defaults to the cache duration defined in your `general.php`. 

## `excludedFieldClasses`

Define field classes that should be excluded from the json response. Used for example for excluding the seo settings field, because SEOmatic has its own API endpoint for that.
