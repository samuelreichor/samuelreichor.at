## Craft CMS Setup
Set up a Craft Cms > 5 project. You could use that [Guide](https://craftcms.com/docs/getting-started-tutorial/install/).

## Install

With ddev: 

```bash
ddev composer require samuelreichor/craft-query-api &&
ddev php craft plugin/install craft-query-api
```

With php: 

```bash
composer require samuelreichor/craft-query-api &&
php craft plugin/install craft-query-api
```

## Configure Cors Origins

Add following config to prevent cors origin errors in that file `config/app.web.php`.
You can find more information about that in the [Craft Docs](https://craftcms.com/docs/4.x/config/app.html#requests-responses).

```php
<?php

  return [
      'as corsFilter' => [
          'class' => \craft\filters\Cors::class,

          // Add your origins here
          'cors' => [
              'Origin' => [
                  'http://localhost:3000',
                  'http://localhost:5173',
              ],
              'Access-Control-Request-Method' => ['GET'],
              'Access-Control-Request-Headers' => ['*'],
              'Access-Control-Allow-Credentials' => true,
              'Access-Control-Max-Age' => 86400,
              'Access-Control-Expose-Headers' => [],
          ],
      ],
  ];
```

## Finish

That's it you can test it by hitting that endpoint `${PRIMARY_SITE_URL}/v1/api/customQuery`. You should get an empty array as response.
