That configurations are optional, but recommended if you plan to use Craft CMS in headless mode only.

## Headless Mode
Set headless mode in your `config/general.php` to true.

Read more about the headless mode [here](https://craftcms.com/docs/getting-started-tutorial/more/graphql.html#optional-enable-headless-mode).

## Enable Preview
To enable previewing entries etc. you have to tell Craft CMS, where the frontend lives.

### Add a new env var:

```php [.env]
WEBSITE_URL="http://localhost:3000"
```

### Add new alias to Craft CMS:

Now add this recently created env var to your `config/general.php` as an alias.

```php [config/general.php]
->aliases([
    '@websiteUrl' => getenv('WEBSITE_URL'),
])
```

### Change Site Url

And finally go to your control panel settings -> sites -> and change the base URL of your Site. If you click on the craft CMS logo in the left top corner, you should land on your defined `WEBSITE_URL`
