The `allRoutes` endpoint retrieves all active routes for a specified `siteId` or for all sites. This is particularly useful for prerendering your pages.

## Basic Usage

To use this endpoint, send a GET request to `${PRIMARY_SITE_URL}/v1/api/allRoutes` to receive an array of routes for all sites.

If you want to fetch routes for a specific site, append the `siteId` to the URL. For example for siteId = 1 you could use the endpoint like that: `${PRIMARY_SITE_URL}/v1/api/allRoutes/1`.

## Advanced Usage

You can pass an array as a URL parameter to the `allRoutes` endpoint by encoding the array as a JSON string and then URL encoding it. This allows you to retrieve routes for multiple `siteIds` in a single request.

### Example

To fetch routes for `siteId` 1 and 2:

```plaintext
https://example.com/v1/api/allRoutes?siteIds=%5B1%2C2%5D
```

#### Breakdown: 
- `https://example.com/v1/api/allRoutes`: Base URL of your API endpoint.
- `?siteIds=`: Query parameter indicating youâ€™re passing siteIds.
- `%5B1%2C2%5D`: URL-encoded JSON string [1,2].
  - `%5B` is [
  - `%2C` is ,
  - `%5D` is ]
