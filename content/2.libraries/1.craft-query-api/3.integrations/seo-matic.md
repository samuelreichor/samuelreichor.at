## Configure SEOmatic

SEOmatic provides its own endpoints, which can be enabled in the plugin settings. I highly recommend checking out the [documentation](https://nystudio107.com/docs/seomatic/advanced.html#headless-spa-api) for more details.

The values of SEOmatic fields are filtered out of the response due to the endpoints mentioned above.
