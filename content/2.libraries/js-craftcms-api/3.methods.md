This API allows building urls for Craft CMS elements (addresses, assets, entries, and users) by providing a querybuilder.

## Supported Element Types

Each element type has its own set of available methods. This ensures precise control and great type safty.

- Addresses
- Assets
- Entries
- Users

::alert{variant="note"}
  Categories, Tags and Globals are not supported because they may be deprecated in the future.
::

## Special Methods

These are methods available for all element types and are not native in Craft CMS.

::alert{variant="tip"}
  When the type is defined as `number[]`, you can always include operator strings such as `not` or `and`. You can find out more about types and methodes in the [source code](https://github.com/samuelreichor/query-api/blob/main/packages/js/src/index.ts).

| Method         | Description                                | Type                |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------|---------------------|
| `fields`       | Select specific fields to retrieve.        | `string` or `string[]` |
| `includeAllEntry` | Whether to include the full data of entries or just the minimal fields (title, URI, ID, and slug). | `boolean` |
| `buildBaseUrl` | Build the url for one() or all()           | `one` or `all` |

::alert{variant="warning"}
If you use the `includeAllEntry` param, be sure that you don't have circular entry relations. This would end up in an endless loop.
