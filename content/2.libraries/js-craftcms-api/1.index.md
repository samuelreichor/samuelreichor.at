## Features
- **Support for Main Element Types:** Query addresses, assets, entries and users.
- **Helper for Preview Mode:** Easily add preview mode to your headless setup.
- **Typesafe:** Built with typescript in mind.
- **Easy Adaptable:** You can easily build your own custom wrapper with that core logic.

## Examples

Want to see how it works?

```ts [app.ts]
import { buildCraftQueryUrl } from '@query-api/js';

// Build URL for fetching a single address
const url = buildCraftQueryUrl('entries')
  .id(1)
  .status('active')
  .siteId(1)
  .buildBaseUrl('one');
// Result: /v1/api/queryApi/customQuery?elementType=addresses&id=1&status=active&siteId=1&one=1
```

It is as simple as that. ðŸš€
