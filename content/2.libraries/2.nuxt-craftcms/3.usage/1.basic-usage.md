Let's dive in and use that thing! This module offers two flexible methods for integrating Craft CMS data into your Nuxt application.

## Connected Components

You can map Craft CMS section handles and matrix block handles to Vue components, enabling the module to automatically render pages and blocks based on your 
content structure. This method simplifies data rendering by letting the module handle the content logic.

## Manually Queries

You can also use the built-in query builder to dynamically fetch Craft CMS data. This approach allows you to construct precise queries and 
retrieve content as you need it.
