## Enable your Authors a better Experience

This plugin is incredibly useful for authors managing content on a website. It allows authors to quickly access the editing interface of entries directly from the frontend, but only if they have the necessary permissions to save the content. This eliminates the need for navigating through the control panel, making content management faster and more efficient.

## How it works 

After installing the Quick Edit plugin and logging into your control panel, a small button will appear in the right corner of your frontend. This button is only visible to logged-in users who have the necessary permission to edit the page.

You can personalize the button’s look and feel by adding your own custom styles. Additionally, you can animate it easily using just CSS to match your site's design and create an even more interactive experience.
