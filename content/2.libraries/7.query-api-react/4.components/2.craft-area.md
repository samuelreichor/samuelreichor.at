The `CraftArea` component renders the mapped React component based on your queried data and the `contentMapping.components` property in your `craftInit()` configuration.

::alert{variant="note"}
  You can read more about configuring components in the [configuration docs](/libraries/query-api-react/get-started/configuration#contentmapping).
::

```tsx
import { CraftArea } from '@query-api/react'

<CraftArea content={content} />
```

`content`: The queried data from Craft CMS. This should be an array of objects containing the entry types and the corresponding data.

## Usage

Typically the `CraftArea` component is used within a React page to render matrix blocks.

::alert{variant="note"}
