The `CraftPage` component renders the mapped React page based on your queried data and the `contentMapping.pages` property in your `craftInit()` configuration.

::alert{variant="note"}
  You can read more about configuring pages in the [configuration docs](/libraries/query-api-react/get-started/configuration#contentmapping).
::

```tsx
import { CraftPage } from '@query-api/react'

<CraftPage content={content} />
```

`content`: The queried data from Craft CMS. This should be an object containing the section handle and its corresponding data.

## Usage

Typically the `CraftPage` component is used within a catch-all route in your React application. This allows it to handle all paths and render the appropriate page based on the queried data.

  If you are curios how to set this up, you can have a look into the [quick start guide](/libraries/query-api-react/get-started/quick-start#display-page).

## Error Handling

If you're using a catch-all route, you can add a `Error` pages to your `contentMapping.pages` mapping. 
This ensures that any unmapped or erroneous sections gracefully display an error page, improving user experience and preventing unexpected behavior.
