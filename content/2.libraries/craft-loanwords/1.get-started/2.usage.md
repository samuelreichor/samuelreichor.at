When you click on `New Loanword` you add new words. After saving, you can use the `a11yTextReplacer()` Twig extension in your templates.

## Usage in Frontent

After saving, you can use the `a11yTextReplacer()` Twig extension in your templates. This automatically replaces loanwords in your content with the correct `<span lang="xx">` tags. 

```[example.twig]

{{ a11yTextReplacer(entry.richText) | raw }}

```

This extension takes an string as an argument.
