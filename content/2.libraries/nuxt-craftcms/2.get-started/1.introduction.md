description: 'An introduction to the @query-api/nuxt SDK for Nuxt.'
---

The `@query-api/nuxt` introduces a powerful query builder to your Nuxt app, allowing you to easily fetch data from Craft CMS, 
similar to how you would query in Twig.

It allows you to connect your Craft CMS sections and entry types to Vue components, making it easy to render dynamic content in your Nuxt applications.

## Requirements

- The [Craft Query API](/libraries/craft-query-api) plugin must be installed and properly configured in Craft CMS.
- Node.js - 20.x or newer (but I recommend the [active LTS release](https://github.com/nodejs/release#release-schedule))
- Nuxt > 3 is required (Nuxt 4 is already supported).

## Supported Element Types

- Addresses
- Assets
- Entries
- Users
